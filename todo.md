### Implementation Plan  
**Priority Order**:  
1. **Task 1** → 2. **Task 2** → 3. **Task 3** → 4. **Task 4** → 5. **Task 5** → 6. **Task 6** → 7. **Task 7** → 8. **Task 8**  

**Rationale**:  
1. Start with **Setup (Task 1)** to establish foundational navigation.  
2. Prioritize **state management (Task 2)** to enable user progress tracking.  
3. Integrate **Farcaster (Task 3)** early to populate real quiz content.  
4. Enable **answer validation (Task 4)** to create interactive flow.  
5. Add **distractors (Task 5)** to improve question quality.  
6. Enhance visuals with **dynamic rendering (Task 6)** for user feedback.  
7. Strengthen reliability with **state validation (Task 7)**.  
8. Optimize speed last **(Task 8)** after core features are stable.
